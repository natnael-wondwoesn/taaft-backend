# Tools Collection Schema Fix Summary

## Problem
The MongoDB tools collection had a schema conflict that needed to be resolved by dropping and recreating the collection with the proper schema.

## Solution Steps

1. **Created a script to drop and recreate the tools collection**
   - Created `drop_tools_collection.py` to drop the existing tools collection
   - Recreated the collection with proper schema and indexes
   - The script ensured all required indexes were created:
     - `id` (unique)
     - `unique_id` (unique)
     - `name`
     - `created_at`
     - `category`
     - `is_featured`
     - Text indexes on `name` and `description`

2. **Updated the database setup code**
   - Modified `app/database/setup.py` to ensure it creates the proper indexes
   - Added explicit logging for index creation

3. **Enhanced the migration script**
   - Updated `migrate_tools.py` to handle the `unique_id` field
   - Ensured all tools have the required fields: `category`, `features`, `is_featured`, and `unique_id`
   - Verified that all tools now have the correct schema

4. **Verification**
   - Created `check_tools_collection.py` to verify the collection schema
   - Confirmed all indexes are correctly set up
   - Ensured data was migrated properly

## Results
- Successfully dropped and recreated the tools collection
- All required indexes are now properly set up
- Existing data has been migrated and verified
- The schema conflict has been resolved

## Next Steps
- Monitor the application for any issues related to the tools collection
- Consider updating any application code that might be affected by the schema changes
- Make sure all downstream services that depend on the tools collection are functioning correctly
